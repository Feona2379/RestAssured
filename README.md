# üß™ API Testing with Rest Assured - ReqRes API

This project demonstrates basic **API testing** using the [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) public API. The tests are written in **Java** using the **Rest Assured** library and **TestNG** framework.

It covers the full CRUD operations:
- `GET`: Retrieve user list
- `POST`: Create a user
- `PUT`: Update a user
- `DELETE`: Remove a user

### üñ• Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8+
- Maven installed
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)

### üß™ Steps to Execute

1. Clone this repo:

```bash

## üß™ API Test Summary

### ‚úÖ `getUsers()`

* Sends a `GET` request to retrieve users from page 2
* Asserts status code = 200
* Validates `page` field value = 2

### üÜï `createUser()`

* Sends a `POST` request to create a new user
* Request body includes `name` and `job`
* Extracts and stores the `id` for use in later tests

### ‚úèÔ∏è `updateUser()`

* Sends a `PUT` request using the previously generated user `id`
* Updates the user's `name` and `job`
* Asserts status code = 200

### ‚ùå `deleteUser()`

* Sends a `DELETE` request using the stored `id`
* Asserts status code = 204 (successful deletion)

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Fluent API pattern: `given() ‚Üí when() ‚Üí then()`
* Using **HashMap** for request payload
* Extracting response data with `.jsonPath()`
* Logging full request/response
* Method dependency using TestNG
* Reusable test structure for REST APIs

---

## üìå Note

* The project uses the `https://reqres.in` public API which **does not actually persist data** ‚Äî it's a mock API used for demonstration purposes.
* The `id` received after user creation is simulated.
